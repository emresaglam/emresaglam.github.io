I’ll try to be brief and not too detailed.</p>

<h1 id="getting-a-dmr-id">Getting a DMR ID</h1>
<p>Go <a href="https://www.radioid.net/register">here</a> and get a DMR ID.
Go <a href="https://brandmeister.network/?page=register">here</a> and get a Brandmeister login.
Go <a href="https://help.brandmeister.us/dashboard/hotspot-security">here</a> and follow to instructions to get a Hotspot Security Password.</p>

<h1 id="setting-up-pi-star">Setting up Pi-Star</h1>
<p>I will not talk about how to install pi-star, there are many good tutorials on the web. Always get the latest version of the pi-star software.</p>

<p>Go to pi-star Configuration page.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Toggle YSF Mode on</li>
  <li>Toggle YSF2DMR on</li>
  <li>Click on Apply Changes button. Wait for pi-star to apply the configuration.
  &lt;img src=/assets/ysf.png&gt;
  </li>
  <li>In the General Configuration section make sure that CCS7/DMR ID is populated with your Radio ID that you got after registering with Radio ID (Link Above).</li>
  <li>*Yaesu Configuration*</li> 
 <li>Under Yaesu System Fusion Configuration section:</li>
 <li>I usually leave the YSF Startup Host blank. But it really doesn't matter. If you will use it JUST for YSF2DMR, then maybe you might want to leave it connected to: YSF00002 That's the default YSF2DMR channel.</li>
 <li>Toggle UPPERCASE Hostfiles on</li>
 <li>Toggle WiresX Passthrough on (This one actually enables code not to be interpreted by the WiresX node, we will need this to be able to switch to a Talk Group on the fly)</li>
 <li>(YSF2DMR)CCS7/DMR ID field choose as 01</li>
 <li>DMR Master: Choose one server that is near you. I use BM 3103 as it's close to me. That's a Brandmeister server in the USA.</li>
 <li>Hotspot Security: Enter here the password that you created with Brandmeister as Hotspot Security. (Link Above)</li>
 <li>DMR TG: This is the ID for the Initial Talk Group that you want to connect. I usually leave this 00091. Talk Group for World Wide.</li>
 <li>Here apply the changes and you should be good to go.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="setting-up-the-radio">Setting up the radio</h1>
<p>I’ll be talking about setting in Yaesu FT3D, but it is similar for most.</p>

<ol>
<li>Dial the radio to the frequency that you set up under General Configuration -&gt; Radio Frequency.</li>
<li>Press the X button (WiresX button).</li>
<li>Once you connect the MMDVM, press Search &amp; Direct button.</li>
<li>Then press the Search &amp; Direct button again (on the second screen)</li>
<li>You will see an ID button on the top left. Press that. This will change the input to 5 digits only.</li>
<li>Type the number: 00002 and press ENT. This will connect the MMDVM to YSF00002 room. This room is the YSF2DMR room.</li>
<li>Then press Search &amp; Direct two times in two different screens again.</li>
<li>And press ID again.</li>
<li>From this point on you can only change Talk Group IDs. You will be in YSF2DMR (YSF00002) room but will be able to switch DMR Talk groups by entering their IDs.</li>
<li>Try your first group something like 00091 (This is TG91 World-Wide DMR channel)</li>
<li>Congrats! :)</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="some-tips">Some tips</h1>
<ol>
<li> Sometimes you need to do a quick press to the talk button, I really don't know why... </li>
<li> You can press and hold BAND button to leave the WiresX or YSF group.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ll update this entry if I see things changing. 73!</p>]]></content><author><name>Emre Sağlam</name></author><category term="general" /><category term="ham radio" /><category term="yaesu" /><category term="dmr" /><category term="pi-star" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this blog entry I will talk about setting up YSF2DMR on pi-star (on a generic MMDVM device).

You stop, the engine stops. Simple. Until it doesn’t…</p>

<p>One thing we learned from the hybrid vehicles is that we can efficiently and automatically start stop gas engines using an auxiliary battery. With hybrid vehicles having a huge battery capacity, not a big deal… With normal gas engines with a tiny battery, well… things don’t go as well as the hybrid ones. :(</p>

<p>Very first sign of a malfunctioning battery is the orange, crossed out ECO sign with a circular arrow on it. This means either your battery is running low, or already dead. If after long drives it disappears, it means it’s still charging. But trust me it’ll die soon.</p>

<p>The battery is a “special battery” by Land Rover. From the size of it, it looks like a motorcycle battery. The part number is: CX23-10C655-AC or LR047630. Exide makes them. You can get a Jaguar/Land Rover branded one, or an Exide branded one. Up to you. As you can see I chose a branded one. I ordered mine online from <a href="https://www.centurylandroverhuntsville.com">Land Rover of Huntsville</a>. Super fast delivery. Kudos to them!</p>

<p>Here is how to replace your battery.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pop out your plastic engine cover. It’s the one on the driver side. (For driving on the right side of the road people) Pull the tab and it’ll pop right out. Check out the picture (before/after) Also remove that gray styrofoam cover. That’s where the battery is.</li>
</ul>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="/assets/img/IMG_0314.jpeg"><img src="/assets/img/IMG_0314.jpeg" /></a></td>
		<td><a href="/assets/img/IMG_0315.jpeg"><img src="/assets/img/IMG_0315.jpeg" /></a></td>
		<td><a href="/assets/img/IMG_0316.jpeg"><img src="/assets/img/IMG_0316.jpeg" /></a></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Prepare your 10 mm socket and a long(ish) socket arm. The battery holder’s nut is pretty deep. This is where you probably need a magnetic socket. I didn’t have one, I survived :) Same socket opens the battery terminal nuts too. You don’t need to completely unscrew them. Just loosen them enough to pop the terminals. Don’t make the same mistake I did.</p>

    <p>Also there is a black “pipe” with a red piece that connects to the battery (for acide fumes coming out of your battery). Don’t forget to disconnect (and reconnect) that too.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="/assets/img/IMG_0319.jpeg"><img src="/assets/img/IMG_0319.jpeg" /></a></td>
		<td><a href="/assets/img/IMG_0320.jpeg"><img src="/assets/img/IMG_0320.jpeg" /></a></td>
		<td><a href="/assets/img/IMG_0321.jpeg"><img src="/assets/img/IMG_0321.jpeg" /></a></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>My original battery was covered with a styrofoam-ish wrap. It’s connected to the battery with double sided tape. I gently removed it from the battery and rewrapped the new one with it. Probably another part that the dealer would have charged few hundreds to me :D</p>

    <p>Below you can find the voltage differences between the old and the new battery and a picture of the properly mounted terminals.</p>

    <p>The rest is to mount everything back in reverse! If you don’t have a magnetic socket I feel sorry for you. ;)</p>

Model number: PDWT380R10SS. It’s one of those that has “touch buttons” on the lid.</p>

<p>This one was made in 2009. It’s in its glorious 11th year as I am writing this blog entry. According to <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/dishwashers/how-to-make-your-dishwasher-last-longer/">Consumer Reports</a>the average life of a dishwasher is 10 years. I already changed the detergent pump of the dishwasher which was clogged because of our mistakes (probably another blog entry).</p>

<p>The “touch buttons” and their LED lights started to fail one by one in the last few years. The last one standing was the Start button (essential functionality). Last week it decided to die too.</p>

<p>I was looking for the part for the last 2 years or so and it is always out of stock. Here is the part number for the “Keypad Assembly”: WD34X11603.</p>

<p>Since we don’t have a functioning dishwasher anymore, I gave a call to GE. Since Covid started they cannot keep up with the parts anymore due to increase of home appliance usage. :( I decided to reverse engineer the buttons. Long story short, I learned a lot how these buttons work but I couldn’t save the keypad assembly.</p>

<p>However I figured out that part number WD34X11587 has actually same connection pattern as WD34X11603! It’s also ~$100 cheaper. It’s missing few “modes” which is totally unused by us anyway. So I ordered it, mounted it and now we have a running dishwasher :)</p>

<p>I hope this helps someone. ;)</p>

<p>Totally unrelated, not really: I ordered this one and few other parts from <a href="http://appliancepartspros.com/">AppliancePartsPros.com</a> and I’m very happy with them. I don’t get paid to write this here. I just like how it was easy and fast.

Let’s see if I will regret this decision in the long run. :)</p>

<p>I tried to move my blog to jekyll, mainly because I don’t want to manage a server side software stack (Mainly PHP, Wordpress and MYSQL). I said I tried, because I wasn’t successful moving everything that I wrote since 2003.</p>

<p>As some of you might know, I had my blog running on 3 different platform in the past years (and this is the 4th) Out of those, first two were written by me. The last one was Wordpress. Because of all these moves, my blog was in a miserable state. Because of these inconsistencies, I really had hard time moving my entire blog to the new jekyll generated github pages.</p>

<p>So, I decided to import everything from 2016 to today (My most inactive years!) and leave the rest (mostly immature ramblings) in <a href="https://archive.emresaglam.com/">https://archive.emresaglam.com</a></p>

<p>Maybe in the future I might move it under the same domain.

<p>First things first, what’s the name of your MD device. You can easily learn that by issuing:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cat</span> /proc/mdstat
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should output something similar to:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">Personalities : [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [raid10]
md0 : active raid5 sdd[1] sda[3] sdb[2]
2929890816 blocks super 1.2 level 5, 512k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/4] [.AAA]
bitmap: 0/8 pages [0KB], 65536KB chunk
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we have a MD device <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/md0</code>. (If you don’t see a response to this, you might have lost your MD device, which could be a bigger issue!)</p>

<p>Another thing that we see (Or we don’t see) here is that sda/sdb/sdd are here in the raid but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sdc</code> is nowhere to be found! This is our problem.</p>

<p>For some reason <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdc</code> is not in the RAID group anymore. Let’s see what’s going on with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdc</code>?</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mdadm <span class="nt">--examine</span> /dev/sdc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my example this was hanging for a long time. When I issue <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dmesg</code> on another console, I was getting a lot of I/O errors about this disk. This is telling me that the disk is malfunctioning.</p>

<p>I shutdown the server and wiggled the disk. Rebooted and it was back online. My array has now four disks however only 3 of them are “functioning” since after the reboot MD kicked <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdc</code> out of the array.</p>

<p>We need to reassemble the array and let RAID5 do its magic. First stop the MD device <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/md0</code>.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mdadm <span class="nt">--stop</span> /dev/md0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then we need to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdc</code> back into the array:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mdadm /dev/md0 <span class="nt">-a</span> /dev/sdc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then depending on the situation we might need to reassemble the array:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mdadm <span class="nt">--assemble</span> /dev/md0 /dev/sd[abcd] <span class="nt">--verbose</span> <span class="nt">--force</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hopefully <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdc</code> is now back in your array now. This should start a long(er) process to sync up the array state to all disks and hopefully you now have your array back!</p>

<p>After the sync completes, I would still do a fsck on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/md0</code> filesystem.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>fsck.ext4 /dev/md0

<p>You can use this same steps (or similar) to remove /dev/sdc and replace with a brand new hard drive. In my case wiggling solved the problem for now. (I probably will need a drive in the near future)</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>docker run <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="nt">--name</span> pihole <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="nv">ServerIP</span><span class="o">=</span>192.168.0.100 <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="nv">WEBPASSWORD</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"myawesomepassword"</span> <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="nv">DNS1</span><span class="o">=</span>8.8.8.8 <span class="nt">-p</span> 9080:80 <span class="nt">-p</span> 53:53/tcp <span class="nt">-p</span> 53:53/udp <span class="nt">-p</span> 9443:443 pihole/pihole:latest
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here in this example above I’m using myawesomepassword as login password to pihole (Change it to your password). I connect the host OS port 9080 to pihole’s port 80 and 9443 to pihole’s port 443.</p>

<p>DNS server is running on port 53. (Since I’m not doing any zone transfer I can leave TCP 53 out, but oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )</p>

<p>You can login to the admin interface in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://192.168.100:9080/admin</code> and start setting your pihole up.</p>

<p>Have fun blocking pesky DNS requests ;)</p>]]></content><author><name>Emre Sağlam</name></author><category term="general" /><category term="dns" /><category term="docker" /><category term="linux" /><category term="pihole" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have few 24/7 running linux boxes at home.

Also at work, like many Bay Area tech companies, we use HipChat (or Slack). Naturally I was inclined to issue a slash command to get the latest air quality index (AQI) for my area in a chat channel. I couldn’t find a good AQI bot so I wrote one.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/Screen-Shot-2017-10-16-at-9.19.51-PM.png"><img src="/assets/img/Screen-Shot-2017-10-16-at-9.19.51-PM.png" alt="Example bot blabber" title="Bot blabber" /></a></p>

<p>Installation for Heroku is on the README of the project. How to add a slash command for HipChat and/or Slack are not covered in this blog entry, but it’s very easy :) (I used /aq &lt;zipcode&gt; for command)</p>

<p>The bot (really an API endpoint) <a href="https://github.com/emresaglam/airbot">is here in my github repo</a>. Feel free to use, improve, contribute to it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Emre Sağlam</name></author><category term="general" /><category term="api" /><category term="git" /><category term="github" /><category term="opensource" /><category term="project" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the devastating Northern California wildfires, I found myself looking at AirNow multiple times a day.
