Model number: PDWT380R10SS. It’s one of those that has “touch buttons” on the lid.</p>

<p>This one was made in 2009. It’s in its glorious 11th year as I am writing this blog entry. According to <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/dishwashers/how-to-make-your-dishwasher-last-longer/">Consumer Reports</a>the average life of a dishwasher is 10 years. I already changed the detergent pump of the dishwasher which was clogged because of our mistakes (probably another blog entry).</p>

<p>The “touch buttons” and their LED lights started to fail one by one in the last few years. The last one standing was the Start button (essential functionality). Last week it decided to die too.</p>

<p>I was looking for the part for the last 2 years or so and it is always out of stock. Here is the part number for the “Keypad Assembly”: WD34X11603.</p>

<p>Since we don’t have a functioning dishwasher anymore, I gave a call to GE. Since Covid started they cannot keep up with the parts anymore due to increase of home appliance usage. :( I decided to reverse engineer the buttons. Long story short, I learned a lot how these buttons work but I couldn’t save the keypad assembly.</p>

<p>However I figured out that part number WD34X11587 has actually same connection pattern as WD34X11603! It’s also ~$100 cheaper. It’s missing few “modes” which is totally unused by us anyway. So I ordered it, mounted it and now we have a running dishwasher :)</p>

<p>I hope this helps someone. ;)</p>

<p>Totally unrelated, not really: I ordered this one and few other parts from <a href="http://appliancepartspros.com/">AppliancePartsPros.com</a> and I’m very happy with them. I don’t get paid to write this here. I just like how it was easy and fast.

Let’s see if I will regret this decision in the long run. :)</p>

<p>I tried to move my blog to jekyll, mainly because I don’t want to manage a server side software stack (Mainly PHP, Wordpress and MYSQL). I said I tried, because I wasn’t successful moving everything that I wrote since 2003.</p>

<p>As some of you might know, I had my blog running on 3 different platform in the past years (and this is the 4th) Out of those, first two were written by me. The last one was Wordpress. Because of all these moves, my blog was in a miserable state. Because of these inconsistencies, I really had hard time moving my entire blog to the new jekyll generated github pages.</p>

<p>So, I decided to import everything from 2016 to today (My most inactive years!) and leave the rest (mostly immature ramblings) in <a href="https://archive.emresaglam.com/">https://archive.emresaglam.com</a></p>

<p>Maybe in the future I might move it under the same domain. But not now. :) Here is to the new beginnings! :P</p>]]></content><author><name>Emre Sağlam</name></author><category term="general" /><category term="blog" /><category term="life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I decided to say good bye to Wordpress today.

<p>First things first, what’s the name of your MD device. You can easily learn that by issuing:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cat</span> /proc/mdstat
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should output something similar to:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">Personalities : [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [raid10]
md0 : active raid5 sdd[1] sda[3] sdb[2]
2929890816 blocks super 1.2 level 5, 512k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/4] [.AAA]
bitmap: 0/8 pages [0KB], 65536KB chunk
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we have a MD device <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/md0</code>. (If you don’t see a response to this, you might have lost your MD device, which could be a bigger issue!)</p>

<p>Another thing that we see (Or we don’t see) here is that sda/sdb/sdd are here in the raid but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sdc</code> is nowhere to be found! This is our problem.</p>

<p>For some reason <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdc</code> is not in the RAID group anymore. Let’s see what’s going on with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdc</code>?</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mdadm <span class="nt">--examine</span> /dev/sdc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my example this was hanging for a long time. When I issue <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dmesg</code> on another console, I was getting a lot of I/O errors about this disk. This is telling me that the disk is malfunctioning.</p>

<p>I shutdown the server and wiggled the disk. Rebooted and it was back online. My array has now four disks however only 3 of them are “functioning” since after the reboot MD kicked <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdc</code> out of the array.</p>

<p>We need to reassemble the array and let RAID5 do its magic. First stop the MD device <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/md0</code>.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mdadm <span class="nt">--stop</span> /dev/md0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then we need to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdc</code> back into the array:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mdadm /dev/md0 <span class="nt">-a</span> /dev/sdc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then depending on the situation we might need to reassemble the array:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mdadm <span class="nt">--assemble</span> /dev/md0 /dev/sd[abcd] <span class="nt">--verbose</span> <span class="nt">--force</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hopefully <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdc</code> is now back in your array now. This should start a long(er) process to sync up the array state to all disks and hopefully you now have your array back!</p>

<p>After the sync completes, I would still do a fsck on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/md0</code> filesystem.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>fsck.ext4 /dev/md0

<p>You can use this same steps (or similar) to remove /dev/sdc and replace with a brand new hard drive. In my case wiggling solved the problem for now. (I probably will need a drive in the near future)</p>

<p>I hope this helped someone. It surely will help me when I will have to do this again 😛</p>]]></content><author><name>Emre Sağlam</name></author><category term="General" /><category term="linux" /><category term="tips" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It happens, you just lost a disk on your RAID5 MD array, or things are not how it should look like… How do we troubleshoot this?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Run pihole without raspberry pi</title><link href="https://blog.emresaglam.com/general/run-pihole-without-raspberry-pi/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Run pihole without raspberry pi" /><published>2019-11-16T10:38:02-08:00</published><updated>2019-11-16T10:38:02-08:00</updated><id>https://blog.emresaglam.com/general/run-pihole-without-raspberry-pi</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.emresaglam.com/general/run-pihole-without-raspberry-pi/"><![CDATA[<p>I have few 24/7 running linux boxes at home. I wanted to try <a href="https://pi-hole.net">pi-hole</a>. But I really didn’t want to add another computer (raspberry pi) on my network.</p>

<p>So my initial feeling was why not try Docker? Good choice. Here is how easy it was.</p>

<p>Pull pihole docker image</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>docker pull pihole/pihole
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Find your local IP (Replace eth0 with your ethernet identifier)</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>ip addr show eth0 | <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="s2">"inet</span><span class="se">\\</span><span class="s2">b"</span> | <span class="nb">awk</span> <span class="s1">'{print $2}'</span> | <span class="nb">cut</span> <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="s2">"/"</span> <span class="nt">-f</span> 1
192.168.0.100
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Get the IP (192.168.0.100 in my case) and run docker:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>docker run <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="nt">--name</span> pihole <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="nv">ServerIP</span><span class="o">=</span>192.168.0.100 <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="nv">WEBPASSWORD</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"myawesomepassword"</span> <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="nv">DNS1</span><span class="o">=</span>8.8.8.8 <span class="nt">-p</span> 9080:80 <span class="nt">-p</span> 53:53/tcp <span class="nt">-p</span> 53:53/udp <span class="nt">-p</span> 9443:443 pihole/pihole:latest
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here in this example above I’m using myawesomepassword as login password to pihole (Change it to your password). I connect the host OS port 9080 to pihole’s port 80 and 9443 to pihole’s port 443.</p>

<p>DNS server is running on port 53. (Since I’m not doing any zone transfer I can leave TCP 53 out, but oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )</p>

<p>You can login to the admin interface in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://192.168.100:9080/admin</code> and start setting your pihole up.</p>

<p>Have fun blocking pesky DNS requests ;)</p>]]></content><author><name>Emre Sağlam</name></author><category term="general" /><category term="dns" /><category term="docker" /><category term="linux" /><category term="pihole" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have few 24/7 running linux boxes at home.

We have close to 250 GB of photos, videos in several different computers and mobile devices. You might have guessed it: it flooded our network since our outbound internet peaks around 6 Mbs (realistically). I needed to do something.</p>

<p>I have at home a <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/products/appliances/mx65">Meraki MX65</a> and a <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/products/wireless/mr42">MR42</a> (Thanks Dağhan ;) ) They give great visibility and control over our home network. I can easily pinpoint where the problem is and take actions. Here is a great chart that shows how the nature of our traffic changed on Sep 24 after turning iCloud Photo Library on. (See the light blue? That’s increased upload!)</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-4.39.41-PM.png"><img src="/assets/img/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-4.39.41-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>One of the easiest way to slow this traffic down is to shape it with Meraki Traffic Shaping rules. <a href="https://documentation.meraki.com/MX-Z/Firewall_and_Traffic_Shaping/Traffic_Shaping_Settings">This document</a> talks about in detail how to do this. However the iCloud settings in the canned traffic shaping rules is only related to backup and doesn’t work with iCloud Photo Library traffic.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-4.55.37-PM.png"><img src="/assets/img/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-4.55.37-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Meraki allows you to do application layer or layer 3 traffic shaping. Since the traffic is encrypted, the application layer traffic shaping was not an option. For layer 3, I needed the IPs that the Photos app was talking to. Since Apple owns the entire 17.0.0.0/8, it’s always an option to craft your rule using the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network#Classful_addressing_definition">class A subnet</a>. However that wouldn’t be “elegant” :) So let’s do some tcpdump exercise.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>iMac:~ user<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>tcpdump <span class="nt">-i</span> en1 <span class="nt">-n</span> <span class="nt">-c</span> 1000 ip and net 17.0.0.0/8 | <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="s1">'&gt;'</span>| <span class="nb">cut</span> <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="s1">'&gt;'</span> <span class="nt">-f</span> 2 | <span class="nb">cut</span> <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="s2">"."</span> <span class="nt">-f</span> 1-4 | <span class="nb">grep </span>17<span class="se">\\</span><span class="nb">.</span> | <span class="nb">sort</span> | <span class="nb">uniq</span> <span class="nt">-c</span> 
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use <span class="nt">-v</span> or <span class="nt">-vv</span> <span class="k">for </span>full protocol decode
listening on en1, link-type EN10MB <span class="o">(</span>Ethernet<span class="o">)</span>, capture size 262144 bytes
1000 packets captured
2120 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
  647  17.248.128.44
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What this tells us is that we captured 1000 packets and looked for all the ones that has “17.” in it, and counted them. In total 647 packets were transmitted to 17.248.128.44. Also it’s on port 443 only.</p>

<p>I did a similar packet dump for 10K packets. Which revealed that the sync between Photos app and iCloud is always happening on subnets: 17.248.0.0/16 and 17.188.0.0/16 on port 443. (There might be a more specific subnet, but this was enough for me to start with)</p>

<p>Let’s apply this to Meraki MX65 traffic shaping rules. In this rule below my upload limit per client is 1.5 Mbps. Depending on how many clients you have and your upload speed, you can come up with something more suitable for your network.</p>

<p>In order to figure out how to define these in Meraki, please <a href="https://documentation.meraki.com/MX-Z/Firewall_and_Traffic_Shaping/Traffic_Shaping_Settings">follow the instructions</a> in the previous doc that I linked.</p>

<p>Also I love that I can download repeater settings according to a zip code, county, state, etc...</p>
<p>I wanted to use Chirp for my <a href="http://www.yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&amp;ProdCatID=249&amp;encProdID=227201D29C822AEFF8482F3367495319">Yaesu FTM-400XDR</a>.

<p>But, that wasn't possible either since Yaesu expects the data in a different order and format.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/emresaglam/chirp2yaesu">small python script</a> that rearranges and reformats the CSV file to the expected import file for the <a href="http://www.yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&amp;ProdCatID=249&amp;encProdID=227201D29C822AEFF8482F3367495319">Yaesu's own software</a>.

<p>By the way, Yaesu's software to program the radio doesn't work on Mac OS X natively, since it's a Windows software.

<p>Well that's it :) This command will sleep for 5 seconds and say "Time is up" at the end of 5 seconds.</p>
